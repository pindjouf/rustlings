// Mary is buying apples. The price of an apple is calculated as follows:
// - An apple costs 2 rustbucks.
// - However, if Mary buys more than 40 apples, the price of each apple in the
// entire order is reduced to only 1 rustbuck!

// TODO: Write a function that calculates the price of an order of apples given
// the quantity bought.
// fn calculate_price_of_apples(???) -> ??? { ??? }
